Official repo documenting the closure of Sunlight Labs

On September 20, 2016, the Board of the Sunlight Foundation announced that it had decided [to shutter Sunlight Labs](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/). On September 21, 2016, [we announced](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/21/whats-next-for-sunlight-labs/) that Labs would officially close on November 11, 2016. This repo has been created to document that closure, and to allow our many community members to let Labs know what they need from us during this process. 

If you are interested in adopting a Labs project, or you are currently using one of our projects and need assistance, please contact [labslove@sunlightfoundation.com](mailto:labslove@sunlightfoundation.com). If you would like to track our process, follow [@sunfoundation](https://twitter.com/SunFoundation), [@sunlightlabs](https://twitter.com/SunlightLabs), and [#sunlabslove](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23sunlabslove) on Twitter for updates.  

We are working with the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) to archive the Sunlight Foundation's websites and data, wherever possible. If there's something you love, that you want to see in the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), open an issue on this repo to let us know! 

Check back for updates until November 11, 2016. 

And now, go do something awesome and sunlighty!
